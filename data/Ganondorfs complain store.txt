I hate everything.

I hate link. He doesn't even deserve to have his name capitalized. I hate zelda. That scaly witch can go fly a kite.

I hate the weird goat people that betrayed my loyalty. I'm over here pledging my allegiance and they won't even let me into their super cool secret sage club! I had to steal a stone instead. I was just so hurt. I'm never included :'(
