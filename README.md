The final project for RB175 at Launch School. A file-based content management system.
This is a project where I'm learning to work with a filesystem.
In most larger apps, I would be using a database, but I haven't learned about those yet.
Also, this is not compatible with deployment on Heroku, because Heroku uses an ephemeral file system and wipes it every 24 hours.
So for now, this is something I'm doing using my local file system.
